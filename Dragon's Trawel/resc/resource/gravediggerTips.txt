You should stay out of the graveyard. It's not safe.
Hard to tell who's who in the unnatural shadow here.
Easy to hide in a graveyard. But harder to see something coming for you.
Watch out for vampires, a few are holed up in crypts around here.
Vampires fear the daylight- and thus we must fear the dark.
Some of the statues here have come to life, waiting for prey.
Don't let your guard down around the statues- some will wait for hours after sighting a target.
At least the swarms of bats are visible even in the dark.
Even if you see another living soul, be on your guard- the graverobbers will bury you themselves if you look at them funny.
