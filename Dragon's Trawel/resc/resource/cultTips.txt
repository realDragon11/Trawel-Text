Blood for the Blood Queen!
Praise flagjaij!
For the blood!
Praise! Praise!
Flagjaij be with you.
Renounce your false gods, Flagjaij is the one true god.
Hail, brother. Bit of snow too.
Glory to- uh, what was our god's name again?
This blood kinda tastes like grape juice.
Do you have a minute to talk about Flagjaij?
I know I was supposed to sacrifice the virgin to Flagjaij today but she's, uh, not eligible anymore.
My eyes are opened unto the truth.
You can't see Flagjaij, but know that they are either red, scarlet, vermilion, carmine. Some shade of red. But not pink.
I hate the headaches after Flagjaij possesses me. But I like what happens during that, so here I am.
...Did anyone ever ask Flagjaij if that's their real name? They never use it.
I hear there is an arena in other time and place that likes blood as much as we do. Shame they don't keep their promises, or I'd be sad the teleporters don't go there.
