<selves> are the best. And let no one make the mistake of thinking otherwise.
There's no job <a> <self> can't do.
I'm <a> <self> and proud of it!
The towns will be under <selvian> rule before long enough.
If it's not <selvian>, it's worthless.
<selves> shall rule!
It should be self-evident that <a> <self> will do a far better job than anyone else.
<town> might not be entirely under <selvian> control yet, but I seek to change that.
