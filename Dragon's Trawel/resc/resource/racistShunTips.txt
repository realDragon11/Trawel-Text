I don't talk with the likes of YOU, <other>.
It's YOUR kind that brings us all down, <other>.
<other>! Everyone in <town> should run you off, like the last <other>!
Oh, one of YOU.
Oh look, a <other>! What's the matter, get lost? A lonely <other>?
<selves> are better than your kind, <other>.
You're the ugliest <other> I've ever seen!
I'm <a> <self> and you're not!
<other>! <other>! <other>!
<other>! Ew! Go away!
Go away <other>!
You're a dirty <other>.
Filthy <other>. The last <other> I saw at least knew to bathe.
Know your place, <other>.
Let's set things straight. I'm <a> <self>. And you're a <other>.
You have no place in <town>, <other>.
<other>, can you even appreciate my <selvian> glory?
