It is strange for us to be away on our anniversary, after so many years together. Take this bottle of perfume so that you may remember me better, and your stay in <town> be made a bit more comfortable.
I hear you've been having monster troubles out there in <town>. We don't have any fancy wards, but take this mixture which can repel normal beasts. Should at least let you save your energy for the real threats.
Cousin, I hear that <other> is in <town> again. Dump this vile fluid on them, then no one will give them the time of day. As usual, take the enclosed money as payment.
