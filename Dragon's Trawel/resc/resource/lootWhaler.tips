I am but a poor <self>- noone will remember our wrecked ship. But we knew the risks. This is not a warning: take these items so that you may use them where we could not.
I knew I would die hunting <other>. But I thought it would be more dramatic. I am starving on a lifeboat, far from shore. I place these items here which are no use to me, in hopes that the heavens might return my act of charity.
Screw the life of a <selvian>. The captain holds their tyranny over us and forbids us from writing home. But I don't care about writing home, just that anyone who claims this message take this prize I stole from the hold, may it serve them better than it can me.
Our hunt for <other> has gone well, and, as customary, we offer this gift back to you, o sea, in return for the charity you have shown us this season.
