Shaman says what shaman says!
Shaman says what spirit says!
Spirit says what shaman says!
Let me cure you.
These healing materials don't come cheap, you know!
I don't care what they say, mint and salmon roe were perfectly good materials for that potion!
Don't let them fool you- my medical license is a lot more intact than my potion making one!
The coven might have kicked me out, but the Doctor's Guild hasn't!
