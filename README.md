# Trawel-Text
An Open-World Text-Adventure RPG built like you were playing it on a calcuator.

If you are vision impaired and using a screenreader for this text, the following portions have inline links. You can find a compiled version at "[real.itch.io/trawel](https://real.itch.io/trawel)", but that might be out of date.

Trawel can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992240/Trawel/) for ~$5 USD, including a graphical GUI and fluff Sounds/Music, not hosted in this repository.
<br>Steam also has a free ($0) demo, the same as the identically priced compiled jar found at [Itch.io](https://real.itch.io/trawel).

If you wish to try the game out and don't mind the [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), Itch or the Steam Demo are your best bets, since they will have compiled jars, as well as JREs and Batch/Shell files to launch the game.

The source code here is frequently in states of disrepair, and likely only [releases](https://github.com/realDragon11/Trawel-Text/releases) will run properly.

Occasionally the Itch/Demo version will lag behind the Steam beta/master, and you will usually be able to compile a more up-to-date version yourself- if the game here isn't horribly broken.

The code here will always be at or ahead of Steam's (even when there is a beta available), because the Steam version merely takes the compiled jars resulting from the code here. The Steam Demo and Itch get updated less frequently.
