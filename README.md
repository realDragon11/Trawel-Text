# Trawel-Text
An open world text adventure rpg.

Currently undergoing a massive rewrite in August 2023 to prepare for a new major version.

If you are vision impaired and using a screenreader for this text, the following portions have inline links. You can find a compiled version at "[real.itch.io/trawel](https://real.itch.io/trawel)", but that might be out of date.      <br>  <br>

  
Trawel can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992240/Trawel/) for ~$5 USD, which also includes a graphical, and for free ($0) on [Itch.io](https://real.itch.io/trawel). The Steam version's demo will be the same as the Itch.io download.

If you wish to try the game out and don't mind the [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), Itch or the Steam Demo are probably your best bet, since they will have compiled jars. (The Steam demo is also comes with both a jre and .batch/.shell files to boot the program easier.)

The source code here is frequently in states of disrepair, and likely only [releases](https://github.com/realDragon11/Trawel-Text/releases) will run properly.

Occasionally the Itch/Demo version will lag behind the Steam beta/master, and you might be able to compile a more up-to-date version; this will probably be the last release in GitHub's sidebar, but that might also be out of date.

The code here will always be at or ahead of Steam's (even when there is a beta available), because the Steam version merely takes the compiled jars resulting from the code here.        <br><br>
