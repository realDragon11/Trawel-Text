# Trawel-Text
An Open-World Text-Adventure RPG built like you were playing it on a calcuator. The code here is intended for educational purposes, transparency, and as a backup if the game eventually becomes abandonware- all rights possible are reserved without keeping it private.

If you are vision impaired and using a screenreader for this text, the following portions have inline links. You can find a compiled version at "[real.itch.io/trawel](https://real.itch.io/trawel)".

Trawel can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992240/Trawel/) for ~$5 USD, including a graphical GUI and fluff Sounds/Music, not hosted in this repository.
<br>Steam also has a free ($0) demo, the same as the identically priced compiled jar found at [Itch.io](https://real.itch.io/trawel).

If you wish to try the game out and don't mind the [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), Itch or the Steam Demo are your best bets, since they will have compiled jars, as well as JREs and Batch/Shell files to launch the game. All of the gameplay is the same between the graphical and and CLI versions.

You can also find compiled Jars in [releases](https://github.com/realDragon11/Trawel-Text/releases) if you have your own JRE.

The code here will always be at or ahead of Steam's (even when there is a beta available), because the Steam Graphical version uses the code hosted here. The Steam Demo and Itch may get updated less frequently- check the version number in [releases](https://github.com/realDragon11/Trawel-Text/releases) if you are unsure.
