# Trawel-Text
An open world text adventure rpg.

Currently undergoing a massive rewrite in August 2023 to prepare for a new major version.

If you are vision impaired and using a screenreader for this text, the following portions have inline links. You can find a compiled version at "[real.itch.io/trawel](https://real.itch.io/trawel)", but that might be out of date.      <br>  <br>

  
Trawel can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992240/Trawel/) for ~$5 USD, which also includes a graphical, which isn't in this repository.
<br> Steam also has a free ($0) demo, which is the same as the compiled jar found on [Itch.io](https://real.itch.io/trawel).

If you wish to try the game out and don't mind the [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), Itch or the Steam Demo are probably your best bet, since they will have compiled jars. (The Steam demo also comes with both a jre and .batch/.shell files to boot the program easier.)

The source code here is frequently in states of disrepair, and likely only [releases](https://github.com/realDragon11/Trawel-Text/releases) will run properly.

Occasionally the Itch/Demo version will lag behind the Steam beta/master, and you will usually be able to compile a more up-to-date version yourself- if the game here isn't horribly broken.

The code here will always be at or ahead of Steam's (even when there is a beta available), because the Steam version merely takes the compiled jars resulting from the code here. The Steam demo and Itch get updated less frequently.        <br><br>
