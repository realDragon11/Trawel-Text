This is not a legally binding document. It is also in progress.

Trawel Text is, by default, all rights reserved. However, different levels of copies will be treated differently. Some likely will never have legal action taken, others will likely be granted contractual exceptions if asked for, but copying the entire thing will likely get you in trouble.

The following terms apply to redistributing Trawel Text code- private copies and modifications will never be considered in violation, only if you redistribute it to other people will things start to get dicey.

Note that there is also an exemption for Github forks, as Github is considered to be able to redistribute the source code freely (as long as this repo is public). Forks are allowed to bypass the following if and only if they are entirely noncommercial (no donations unless a contractual exemption) and they are not designed with the intention of undermining Trawel Text or replacing it (ie, they should not be entirely new games using Trawel, because Trawel is not an engine), otherwise they are not permitted.

Small bits of code that are likely uncopyrightable anyway (due to their atomic nature) will be treated as CC0.

Larger sections of code, but still code that is isolated to a single task, will often be treated as MIT, although if copying effectively an entire class, it is recommended to ask first and get a contract to secure your legal safety.

You should not copy systems from within Trawel Text, but if there is demand for one system to be copied, I may take that as a sign to pull it into its own library and license that with MIT.


To ask for an exemption, mail my (somewhat unchecked) mail.com email, or find me on Discord.
